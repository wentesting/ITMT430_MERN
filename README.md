# Description of Project IITrade:
A web application where IIT community can sell, trade, and buy items from fellow peers! On the web application, you will able to sign in as an IIT community member with a google account to create or request postings. In the posting of an item, an IIT member will be listing it with a description, photo, and tags that attribute to what it is. This means we will create a storage solution for images and tagged photosystem allowing IIT members to browse or search up items they might want to get. When a community wants to get an item, they will be able to add it to a cart. From the cart, community members will be able to send a “request” to the buyer which means they want to buy/trade the item. If not ready to buy, there will be a contact option that will allow you to email the seller. Posting will be either available, selling, or sold. Happy IITrading!
