### Anonymous/Registered User Story

![Step 1](UX_UI_Images/student_user/1.png "Step 1")
I, as an **anonymous user**, am able to see initial items on the homepage. I am able to only see items but if I want to take USER actions like SAVE, REQUEST, SELL, BUY, I will be direct to login in and sign up. 

![Step 2](../diagrams/UX_UI_Images/student_user/2.png "Step 2")
To be able to look at any item in detail, I need to login with my username and password or sign up.

![Step 3](../diagrams/UX_UI_Images/student_user/3.png "Step 3")
Since I am a first time user, I need to create an account with Name, Email, and Password, now Phone number and SIGN UP.

You need to become a registered user!
