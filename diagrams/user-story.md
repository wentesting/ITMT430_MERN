After submitting the request, I receive a request receipt with a confirmation number, information about the item and information about the seller. Once done reviewing the request, I go back to the main page by clicking on CONTINUE SHOPPING.

For the Posted Items List, I see one of my posted items has been requested by a potential buyer because the DENY and APPROVE buttons are enabled. This is under the assumption the buyer and seller have communicated transition details on their own through email (or chosen platform). Or I want to review the product information so I click on VIEW.
